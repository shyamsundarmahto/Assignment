    "# Q.1 What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for a variety of purposes across different industries and applications due to its ability to efficiently extract data from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are some common reasons why web scraping is used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Price Monitoring\n",
    "Web Scraping can be used by companies to scrap the product data for their products and competing products as well to see how it impacts their pricing strategies. Companies can use this data to fix the optimal pricing for their products so that they can obtain maximum revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Market Research\n",
    "Web scraping can be used for market research by companies. High-quality web scraped data obtained in large volumes can be very helpful for companies in analyzing consumer trends and understanding which direction the company should move in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. News Monitoring\n",
    "Web scraping news sites can provide detailed reports on the current news to a company. This is even more essential for companies that are frequently in the news or that depend on daily news for their day-to-day functioning. After all, news reports can make or break a company in a single day!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "If companies want to understand the general sentiment for their products among their consumers, then Sentiment Analysis is a must. Companies can use web scraping to collect data from social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter as to what the general sentiment about their products is. This will help them in creating products that people desire and moving ahead of their competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Email Marketing\n",
    "Companies can also use Web scraping for email marketing. They can collect Email ID’s from various sites using web scraping and then send bulk promotional and marketing Emails to all the people owning these Email ID’s."

    "# Q.2  What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ans\n",
    "The different methods used for Web Scraping are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Human Copy-and-Paste\n",
    "   * Manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet is the most basic form of web scraping. Even the best web-scraping technology cannot always replace a human’s manual examination and copy-and-paste, and this may be the only viable option when the websites for scraping explicitly prohibit machine automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Text Pattern Matching\n",
    "   * This can be a simple technique but yet a powerful method of extracting data or information from the internet. Most web pages may be based on the UNIX grip command or even regular-expression matching resources of the commonly used programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The common ones being for instance Perl and Python. With this technique of web scraping, it is important to realize that a lot of information can be obtained by our web scraping services in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. HTTP Programming\n",
    "   * It may sometimes be a real challenge in retrieving information from dynamic and static web pages. Our web scraping adequately caters to this and thereby guarantees data from such sites. This may be done by posting HTTP requests to the remote servers by using socket programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * By this, we ensure our clients will get accurate data that may present a challenge to obtain from such pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. HTML Parsing\n",
    "   * Many websites contain large collections of pages that are dynamically generated from an underlying structured source, such as a database. A common script or template is typically used to encode data from the same category into similar pages. A wrapper is a program in data mining that detects such templates in a specific information source, extracts its content, and converts it to a relational form.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Wrapper generation algorithms assume that the input pages of a wrapper induction system follow a common template and can be identified using a URL common scheme. Furthermore, semi-structured data query languages such as  XML Query Language and Hyper Text Query Language(HTQL) can be used to parse HTML pages as well as retrieve and transform page content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. DOM Parsing\n",
    "   * More information: Object Model for Documents(DOM), Programs can retrieve dynamic content generated by client-side scripts by embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as Internet Explorer or the Mozilla browser control. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, which programs can use to retrieve portions of the pages. The resulting DOM tree can be parsed using languages such as Xpath.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Vertical Aggregation\n",
    "   * Several companies have created vertically specific harvesting platforms. These platforms generate and monitor a plethora of “bots” for specific verticals with no “man in the loop” (direct human involvement) and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation entails creating a knowledge base for the entire vertical, after which the platform will create the bots automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The robustness of the platform is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (typically the number of fields) and its scalability (how quickly it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is primarily used to target the Long Tail of sites that common aggregators find too difficult or time-consuming to harvest content from.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Semantic Annotation Recognizing\n",
    "   * The scraped pages may include metadata, semantic markups, and annotations that can be used to locate specific data snippets. This technique can be viewed as a subset of DOM parsing if the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does. In another case, the annotations are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Computer Vision Web-Page Analysis\n",
    "   * There are efforts using machine learning and computer vision to identify and extract information from web pages by visually interpreting pages as a human would."

    "\n",
    "6. Monitoring and Alerting: It can be used to monitor websites for changes in content.   \n",
    "   * For example, it can be used to track price changes on e-commerce websites and send alerts when prices drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Testing and Debugging: Beautiful Soup can be used in testing scenarios to verify if a web page's structure and content meet certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Content Extraction for NLP: In natural language processing (NLP) projects, Beautiful Soup can be used to extract text content from web pages for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Data Cleaning and Preparation: It can be used to clean and restructure HTML data, making it more suitable for analysis or storage."
