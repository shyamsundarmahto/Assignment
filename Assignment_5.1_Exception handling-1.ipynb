    "\n",
    "* An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program. When   an exception occurs, Python raises an exception object that can be caught and handled by the program to prevent it from   crashing. Exceptions are used to handle errors and exceptional situations in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Exceptions allow us to gracefully (appropriately)Â deal with errors and exceptional cases in our code, ensuring that our   programme can continue running despite encountering issues.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Some common examples of exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ZeroDivisionError: Raised when attempting to divide by zero.\n",
    "  * TypeError: Raised when an operation is performed on an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "  * ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of correct type but inappropriate value.\n",
    "  * IndexError: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range in a sequence (e.g., list, tuple).\n",
    "  * KeyError: Raised when trying to access a dictionary key that doesn't exist.\n",
    "  * FileNotFoundError: Raised when trying to open or access a file that does not exist.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  The difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Exceptions:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Exceptions are runtime errors that occur while a program is running, after the code has passed the syntax-checking         phase.\n",
    "  * It happen when something unexpected or exceptional occurs during the execution of your code. \n",
    "  * This could be due to user input, external factors like file I/O, or mathematical operations that result in errors         (e.g., division by zero).\n",
    "  * Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks. You can anticipate and catch specific exceptions, allowing your         program to continue running gracefully even if an error occurs.\n",
    "  * Python provides a wide range of built-in exceptions, such as ValueError, TypeError, and ZeroDivisionError, to handle       various error scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Syntax Errors:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Syntax errors are also known as parsing errors.\n",
    "  * They occur when you write code that does not conform to the rules and structure of the Python language.\n",
    "  * Examples of syntax errors include missing colons at the end of control statements (if, for, while), incorrect             indentation, misspelled variable names, and using reserved words incorrectly.\n",
    "  * Syntax errors prevent your code from being executed at all. Python's interpreter raises a SyntaxError immediately when     it encounters a syntax error.\n",
    "  * You need to fix syntax errors before you can run your code."

If it is still unhandled at that time, the programme stops and an error message is displayed to the user (containing information about the exception type and the traceback).This process is called \"unhandled exception propagation\" and can lead to an abrupt (sudden) program termination."
