    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ans\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. It acts as a centralized repository where data can be stored, managed, and accessed by software applications or users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Structure:\n",
    "  * SQL Databases:\n",
    "    * SQL databases are also known as relational databases.\n",
    "    * They are based on a predefined schema, which means the structure of the data (tables, columns, relationships) is fixed before the data is added.\n",
    "    * Data is organized in tables with predefined columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema.\n",
    "    * They can be document-oriented, key-value stores, wide-column stores, or graph databases.\n",
    "    * Data can be stored in various formats like JSON, BSON, XML, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Relational vs. Non-Relational:\n",
    "  * SQL Databases:\n",
    "    * SQL databases use a structure that allows you to define relationships between different pieces of data.\n",
    "    * They are based on the relational model and follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema or predefined relationships.\n",
    "    * They may be non-relational or loosely relational, and they often follow the CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Scalability:\n",
    "  * SQL Databases:\n",
    "    * Traditionally, SQL databases have faced challenges with horizontal scalability, which means it can be more difficult to scale them across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "    * NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, making them more suitable for handling large amounts of data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Use Cases:\n",
    "  * SQL Databases:\n",
    "    * Well-suited for applications that require complex query operations, transactions, and where data integrity and consistency are critical.\n",
    "    * Commonly used in applications like financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and applications with complex reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "    * Often used in scenarios where high throughput, scalability, and flexibility in data modeling are crucial.\n",
    "    * Commonly employed in applications like real-time analytics, content management systems, and large-scale web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Examples:\n",
    "  * SQL Databases:\n",
    "    * MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "    * MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, Neo4j."

    "Data Definition Language(DDL) is a category of SQL commands that are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of a database and its objects. DDL commands are used to create, alter, and drop database objects like tables, indexes, views, and schemas.\n",

    "### CREATE:\n",

    "\n",
    "### DROP:\n",
    "* The DROP command is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, or databases.\n",
    "  * Example (dropping a table):\n",
    "    * DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "### ALTER:\n",
    "* The ALTER command is used to modify existing database objects, such as adding or deleting columns in a table, renaming objects, or modifying data types.\n",
    "  * Example (adding a column to a table):\n",
    "    * ALTER TABLE customers ADD phone_number VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "    \n",
    "### TRUNCATE:\n",
    "* The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all records from a table, but it retains the structure of the table for future use.\n",
    "  * Example (truncating a table):\n",
    "    * TRUNCATE TABLE customers;"

    "# Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ans\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a special field or combination of fields in a database table that uniquely identifies each record (row) in the table. It serves as a reference point for establishing relationships between different tables in a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Some important points about primary keys are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Uniqueness: Each value in a primary key column must be unique. This ensures that no two records in the table can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Non-null: A primary key field cannot contain null values. Every record must have a valid, non-null value in the primary key column.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Immutable: Ideally, the values in a primary key should be immutable, meaning they should not change over time. This helps maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Single Field or Composite Key: A primary key can be a single field or a combination of multiple fields that, when combined, form a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Indexed: In most database systems, a primary key is automatically indexed. This improves query performance when searching for specific records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a table of students, a primary key could be the student ID, as each student would have a unique ID number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a field in a database table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables by linking a field in one table to a field in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some important points about foreign keys are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Referential Integrity: A foreign key enforces referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the foreign key column match values in the corresponding primary key column of the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Relationships: Foreign keys are used to define relationships between tables. \n",
    "  \n",
    "    For example, in a database with separate tables for customers and orders, a foreign key in the orders table might reference the customer ID in the customers table.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Can Contain Null Values: Unlike a primary key, a foreign key can contain null values. This allows for optional relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In an orders table, a foreign key might reference the customer ID in a customers table. This establishes a relationship between orders and customers, indicating which customer placed each order."

    "* cursor.execute() is used to execute an SQL query. In this example, we're executing a simple SELECT query, but we can use any valid SQL statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Fetching Results:\n",
    "* After executing a query, we can use cursor.fetchall() to retrieve the results. This method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Displaying Results:\n",
    "* In this example, we're iterating through the results and printing each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Closing Cursor and Connection:\n",
    "* It's important to close the cursor and connection once we're done using them. This releases any resources held by them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Explanation of cursor() and execute() methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### cursor() Method:\n",
    " * cursor() is a method of the connection object. It creates a new cursor that allows us to execute SQL queries and retrieve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### execute() Method:\n",
    " * execute() is a method of the cursor object. It is used to execute an SQL query. we pass the query as a string to this method. If the query is a SELECT statement, it fetches the result set. For other queries like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE, it performs the operation on the database."
