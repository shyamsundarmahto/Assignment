    "* Abstraction: The abstraction is a fundamental concept in programming and software enginnering that involves hiding complex     implementation details and showing only the essential features of an objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Method overiding: Redefining a method in a subclass to provide a specific implementation.\n",

    "In OOP's, The __init__() function is a special method, also known as the constructor, that is used to initialize the      attributes (properties) of an object when it is created from a class. It is automatically called when an object is  instantiated, allowing you to set initial values for the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the __init__() function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attribute Initialization: When we create an object from a class, we often want to provide initial values for its               attributes. The __init__() method allows us to define these initial values, ensuring that every object created from the       class starts with the specified attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Custom Initialization Logic: Sometimes, we need to perform certain actions or calculations when an object is created. The     __init__() method gives us flexibility to include custom logic that runs during object instantiation. This can be             helpful for setting up the object's state or performing any necessary preparations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensuring Consistency: By using the __init__() method, we can ensure that objects are always created in a consistent and       valid state. This can help prevent unexpected behavior and errors later in your program.\n",
